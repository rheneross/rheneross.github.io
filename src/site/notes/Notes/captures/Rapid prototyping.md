> It took me 3 years to admit failure with my first.  
> It took me 1 year to realize the game concept I had was built wrong and couldn’t ship.  
> Now, I can build prototypes in 3-6 months to evaluate if an idea is worth exploring.  
> Here’s the framework I use:👇  
>   
> First: What is the dirtiest, quickest path to evaluating the idea?  
> Next: "Does 10% more effort in a specific way dramatically improve the test quality?"  
> - When building a single-player game concepts, it doesn’t matter which game engine you use, as long as you can prototype quickly.  
> - When building a competitive, real-time multiplayer game, prototyping locally can be problematic. Switching to the architecture required for effective playtesting later is 10x more costly.  
> - Investing extra time initially to learn the correct approach helps avoid common bugs later.  
>   
> Once the tech is sorted, do the same with the art:  
> Ask First - "How can we communicate clearly with a minimum amount of investment?"
> - Simple shapes, a simple environment, and colored flashes might be enough.  
> Ask Next - "Does 10% more effect in a specific way dramatically level up the test quality?"
> - Making a colored cube wobble, jiggle and flash doesn’t take a lot of work, but dramatically levels up the prototype quality.

> Jakob gets a lot of mileage out of a minimum of assets.

> If something doesn’t work out?  
>   
> No big deal, you didn’t waste the hearts, souls, and passions of your team.  
>   
> That said, it can be INCREDIBLY hard when you have talented people around and not use their skills to the fullest extent.  
>   
> This is why working with senior developers is a completely different experience than working with juniors.  
>   
> Because senior developers have (hopefully) come to peace with their skill in their craft, they can focus on just doing the essential to validate your hypothesis:

> Is this fun?

> Be the Funsmith, not the pixel pusher.

> Caveat: Some games won’t really deliver on the experience without clearly communicated animations, timing and visuals. Elden Ring, for example, wouldn’t work with Minecraft-style animations.

> Act wisely.
