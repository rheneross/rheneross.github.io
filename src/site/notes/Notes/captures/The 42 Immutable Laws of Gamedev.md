1. Use source control or at least make regular backups
2. Your game is likely both too boring and too shallow
3. Your pitch should include a budget
4. Your budget should be justifiable using non-outlier comparators
5. A stupid idea that would make your friends laugh is often a great concept
6. Criticise a game you hate by making a good version of it
7. Changing a core mechanic usually means that you need a new ground-up design
8. Design documents are only bad because most people write them badly
9. Make the smallest viable prototype in each iteration
10. Players need an objective even if they are looking to be distracted from it
11. ​​No genre is ever dead or oversaturated
12. Games in difficult categories need to be doing something truly exceptional.
13. ​​Learn the history of games
14. Forget the history of games! Unpredictable novelty arises every year
15. Great games have been made by both amazing and terrible coders
16. ​​Be as messy as you want to get your game design locked…
17. ​​…then think about readability, performance, extensibility, modularity, portability…
18. ​​Procedural generation is a stylistic choice not a cost-reduction methodology
19. ​​Depth is almost always more important than UX
20. ​​Plan for exit even if you plan to never exit
21. ​​Your opinion of DLC is likely not based on data
22. ​​There’s no point owning your IP unless you use it, license it or sell your company
23. ​​PR will always matter but most devs don't understand what PR is
24. ​​People want to hear about even the most mundane parts of your dev process.
25. Be grateful when you win awards and gracious (or silent) when you don't
26. Announce your game and launch your Steam page simultaneously
27. ​​Get your Steam tags right
28. ​​Make sure your announcement trailer destroys its intended audience
29. ​​Excite, intrigue, inspire with possibilities
30. ​​Your announcement is an invitation to your game’s community
31. Make “be respectful” a community rule and enforce it vigorously
32. Celebrate great community members
33. ​​Post updates at minimum once per month
34. ​​Community trust is established by correctly calling your shots
35. ​​Find an accountant who understands games
36. ​​Understand salaries, dividends and pension contributions fully
37. ​​Find a lawyer you can trust with anything
38. Read contracts as if the identity of the counterparty was unknown to you
39. ​​A publisher without a defined advantage is just expensive money
40. ​​Just because you had a bad publisher once doesn’t mean all publishers are bad
41. “Get publisher money” is hustling. “Make a profitable game” is a real ambition
42. Keep trying - be specific, optimistic and generous
