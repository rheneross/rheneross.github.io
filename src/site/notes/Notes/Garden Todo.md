Most of my notes are not yet available, there is still a lot of seeds to sow.

There's also a lot of changes to be made to the site itself:
	- Change the default icon
	- Add a [Signpost](https://hermitage.utsob.me/#signpost) icon
		- Also make signpost page with dataview like the one I did for [[Notes/Garden Reading Notes\|Reading Notes]]
	- Update the sidebar so it's stuck to the left: https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/blob/main/src/site/styles/custom-style.scss
	- Add a favicon
	- Add comments: https://dg-docs.ole.dev/advanced/guides-and-how-tos/adding-comments/
	- add a last updated page
