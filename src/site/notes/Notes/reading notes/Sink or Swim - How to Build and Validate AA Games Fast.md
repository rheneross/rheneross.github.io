My notes on the GDC 2024 Talk [Sink or Swim: How to Build and Validate AA Games Fast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ha0UHvCmKU) by [Carina Kom](https://bsky.app/profile/car2n.bsky.social)

Smooth sailing does not make good sailors

## One Pager is a compas
-> Tool to point toward the visions
Anatomy:
- Overall concept
- Target Audience
- Unique Selling Point
- Game Mechanics
- Monetization Strategy ?
- Technical Requirements

## Lean Canvas is a map
Anatomy:
- Competitors
- Challenges/Risks
- Solutions
- Target Audience / Player segment
- Platform
- Pitch
- Team advantage
- KPI
- Marketing
### How to build a lean canvas
"What we love about this genre"
"What we love about that genre"
--> Pitch
==> Put your community / target audience

Identify target audience with
- Bartle type https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartle_taxonomy_of_player_types
- Platform

Uncover player journey
Example:
-> Signing in the game, First player experience
-> Connecting with a friend

Value proposition
-> List objectives / jobs from player perspective
-> List Gain / Pain from those jobs
=> Value offering should releave pains and augment gains
Every gain and pain should be connected to a solution

### MVP
Start with a solution that MAXIMALIZE the value provided
-> Talk to your players
-> How to scale up
-> Manage expectations when delivering an MVP
-> Iterate and separate yourself from your competitors

### Prototype
Test and validate a concept or an idea
Cheaper that the MVP
-> Align stakeholders
-> Decide if you want to move forward with an MVP
Prototype tests:
	- Moderated Usability Testing
	- Remotely moderated Usability testing
	- Unmoderated Usability testing
Type of tests:
(Always with a limited number of questions)
- Explorative
- Usability
-  A/B Testing
- Surveys/Questionnaires
- Focus group
- Expert review

## Ship fast & Open
Open:
-> Immediate feedback
-> Super fans: Reduced time on testing cycles
-> Extra user research
-> Morale improvements

### Challenges to shipping fast
#### Not sustainable -> rushing

=> Change request process

Change Request
Anatomy:
- Status ( Approved / Denied )
- Stakeholder (Better if we can refer to it by name)
- Estimation of complexity / ETA (Optimistic / Pessimistic)
- Assessment notes

#### Unintentional blindness
Tunnel vision

Communicate with others about risks 

=> Risk register
To be prepare
