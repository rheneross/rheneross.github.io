# Vision
- Cultivate it
	- Get feedback
- Learn how to communicate it
- GRAND vision
- Continuously use the vision
	- When something is not possible, go back to the vision: what was the original intent between it
	- Prioritize with it
	- When hiring / partnering
- Money is never part of the vision

## Exercice
- Vividly imagining the vision
- Try explaining it to others
- Is it worth fighting for
- Are you working on the right vision?

# Risk
Risk is always experienced from the inside, it's in every decision you takes between your starting point and going toward your vision
25-35: Best moment to take big risks
35+: Calculated risks
# Valuation
- Money / Time
- Team history
- IP Rights
- External validation
- Soft elements
	- Culture
	- Reputation

Make as much Value as possible before letting external money in

# Team
- Critical to build something bigger than you
- Always hire people that are better than you
- Self-motivated people
- Team skills define what you can make
- Culture is one of the key things

# You
- Always start inexperienced
- You need to lean a lot
- Navigate stress and pressure
- Be critical / be able to take critics
- No one cares about your goals -> if you are good at sharing the vision you can make people care about the vision
- You need to level up!

# Pitfalls
- Avoid trends and the idea of quick win
	- Have a vision that can stand the test of time
- Don't sacrifice culture for talent
- Loss of focus

# Conclusion
- No one will remember your small vision
- First game/project will be your hardest birth
	- Cut scope not quality
- Find like-minded people and share ideas
	- Mentors, peers, other company owners
- Be kind, generous, friendly
- Never stop learning

ENJOY THE PROCESS! 
-> Focus on the Process
