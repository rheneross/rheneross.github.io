Some #quotes from the article [The Reverse Centaur’s Guide to Criticizing AI](https://pluralistic.net/2025/12/05/pop-that-bubble/#u-washington) by [Corry Doctorow](https://craphound.com/bio/)

> I'm not saying that tech bosses are making bets they don't plan on winning. But I am saying that winning the bet – creating a viable metaverse – is the secondary goal. The primary goal is to keep the market convinced that your company will continue to grow, and to remain convinced until the next bubble comes along. 

> "And if the AI misses a tumor, this will be the human _radiologist's_ fault, because they are the 'human in the loop.' It's their signature on the diagnosis."
> 
> This is a reverse centaur, and it's a specific kind of reverse-centaur: it's what Dan Davies calls an "accountability sink." The radiologist's job isn't really to oversee the AI's work, it's to take the blame for the AI's mistakes.

> To pop the bubble, we have to hammer on the forces that created the bubble: the myth that AI can do your job, especially if you get high wages that your boss can claw back; the understanding that growth companies _need_ a succession of ever-more-outlandish bubbles to stay alive; the fact that workers and the public they serve are on one side of this fight, and bosses and their investors are on the other side.
