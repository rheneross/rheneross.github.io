This is my notes on the [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0E4z56vhOc) [Stuffed Wombat](https://bsky.app/profile/stuffedwomb.at) gave at ALUOigrice.

3 types of game designers:
[He already talked about that in his blog](https://stuffedwomb.at/threeways)
1. Explorers
	1. Look at something really closely - Deconstruct
	2. Look at something from really far away - Abstract
	3. Find something new to look at (go outside!) - Do something new / Broaden horizons
2. Stealers
3. Workers
Ultimately, you have to do all 3

> I am very slow at committing to a game idea, but once I commit, I COMMIT

=> It's also important for collaborators, they know they can rely on you

Development process
1. Explore
2. Experiment
3. Expression
	What do I want to say / express through this game
	If I don't find what I want to say, I will never commit to full production
4. Execution
	Now I create the game project that is going to be shipped
	1. Beginning - Making a skeleton
	2. Middle - Add more and more stuff
	3. End - Cut radically
5. Exhaustion
	Post-launch depression - always happens, can be mitigated

Huge anxiety & fears before releasing the first games

For Stuffed Wombat, his creative process came from inside a protective layer:
- He is now confident in his creative process, and even if it didn't work he made good connections within the game industry
- He could always move back with his parents (what he did when starting to create games)
=> But it is still always scary. If it's not, it means it's not interesting enough

Fear of Failure is never to go away, even with a lot of experience

If he fails in his creative process, he goes back one step - it's ok to go back

Success means to be exhausted.
Success is releasing a game.
