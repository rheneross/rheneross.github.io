My notes from the [talk](https://youtu.be/fKJDv8NI9T0) [René Habermann](https://bsky.app/profile/bippinbits.bsky.social) gave at GameCamp 2025.

## Framework
A framework on how to be sustainable as an indie game studio.

Game Jam => Feedbacks 
Feedbacks:
- rating
- comments
- 10min experience played for 10s of hours

Don't necessarily validate your game idea on social media, Dome Keeper didn't had a lot of social media traction.

Demo release peaked
- broad appeal
- some virality

Timeline:
3 days game jam
8 weeks refined prototype to demo
9 months to release (2 demos)

Never stop having new people in the demos

Validations points :
- should we abandoned the project

Core fancy: not a vertical slice.

## What's a wrong game
A game that makes you close the studio

- Undesired: not enough follower / wishlist => no positive validation
	- didn't validate against the market
	- or dev. Don't listen for result of validation
- misaligned: a lot of people want what they thought you were making, but it's different from what you where making
	- lot of positive validation
	- decent launch day
	- causes:
		- comms on game are off
		- devs didn't understand or respect player sentiment
		- validation and playtest only with a closed player group => keep testing first player XP
	- how to avoid
		- keep testing first player XP, keep adding players to playtest, keep playtesting
		- align the entire team
		- define experience goals for your game and check against them during dev
		- build for the players
		- keep it playable
- overdeveloped : spent too much time developing, don't recoup:
	- positive validation
	- medium metric
	- made a huge multi-year project
	- causes:
		- dev loves the game too much
		- too little prod. Constraints
		- insecure / volatile opinions / keep redoing stuff again and again
		- overspend on art
	- how to avoid
		- use validation points to inform scope of next step
		- retain prototyping spirit
		- flexible scope
		- go by experience goals, not feature liste
- game shipped well, but every one is burned out

## How to make a prototype
Guidelines
- Keep it simple
	- clarify requirements as soon as possible, if you don't know how to clarify : keep it simple
	- for example don't build map génération before doing map by hand (maybe with some chunk randomization ) so you can use player feedback to improve and build the actual generation later
- alternative shortcut
	- instead of doing the actual solution 
- 80% is enough
	- save time and move on

## Validating prototype
Let people play your game
- especially unfriendly internet people
- you learn with ever playtest
- keep you motivated

Form an holistic view with multiple points:
- game jam results
	- but also number of ratings (test appeal)
- playtest
- social media hype
- itch.io ratings / appeal /...
- how many plays does this game needs for a player to leave feedback
- comments : 
	- small nice comments, not a good sign
	- long / emotional comments show better appeal
- media reception for game jam is a positive point
- YouTube videos even for game jam
	- ppl make a video : good
	- variation in views (better views than average for example)
- do we feel passionate about the game
- do we have a vision for the full game
- do our skills match with what's needed
- talk about your game
	- do people get existed
	- do they add their own ideas

All this should paint a clear picture
