https://youtu.be/9Yomqk0C6kE

Valve's game development process:
1. Start with a goal
2. Design something - Hypothesis
3. Evaluate if design reach the goal by doing a playtest - Experiment to validate Hypothesis
4. Iterate


- Test early
- Test often (every week)
	- Player don't look up
	- Player don't learn when stressed
- Shut up and watch
	- Post game questionnaire can help as well
- Designer run playtests
- Challenge your assumptions
