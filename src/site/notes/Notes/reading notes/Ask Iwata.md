I didn't take any notes at the start of the book, but I'm going to save some #quotes here.

> another question I like to ask: "Out of all the work you've done so far, what was the most interesting thing? And what was the most painful?"
> About interviews, p.34


This quote reminds me of the concept of [[Notes/reading notes/Flow\|Flow]]:
> When the reward feels like it's greater than the energy and effort we've expended, we don't give up. But when the result of all our efforts is a disappointment, we tend to fail. I think these conditions are essential to making games that people want to play
> p.52


> I've been thinking: people waste time worrying about problems that can't be solved by worrying. If worrying would solve the problem, then I'd say go ahead and worry, but somehow we can't stop ourselves even when worrying solves nothing and leaves us empty-handed.
> p.62


> When I'm really hooked on something, as long as I can figure out what got me hooked, I can take that process and apply it elsewhere as a way of drumming up interest.
> p.63
