## Scales
### Notes
In a scale, notes are numbered with roman numbers:
I II III IV V VI VII
### Major Scale
- Root Note - I
- Whole Step - II
- Whole Step - III
- Half Step - IV
- Whole Step - V
- Whole Step - VI
- Whole Step - VII
### Minor Scale
- Root Note - I
- Whole Step - II
- Half Step - III
- Whole Step - IV
- Whole Step - V
- Half Step - VI
- Whole Step - VII

## Chords
### Basic Chords
Multiple notes in the scale played simultaneously.
#### Major chord
I, III, V in a major scale
#### Minor chord
I, III, V in a minor scale
Basically correspond to I, III minus half step, V in a major scale
#### Chords are always
- Major - I, III, V - Chord I
- Minor - II, IV, VI - Chord II
- Minor - III, V, VII - Chord III
- Major - IV, VI, I - Chord IV
- Major - V, VII, II - Chord V
- Minor - VI, I, III - Chord VI
### Chord progressions
A suite of chords in a particular order.
Most notable would be:
- I, VI, II, V
- II, V, I
- I, V, VI, IV
### Spicy Chords
#### 7
- maj7 - Major 7th - Add the VI note
- 7 - 7th Chord (or dom7 - dominante 7th) - Add the VI note, down a half step
- min7 - Minor 7th - Add the VI note in a minor scale
#### add 2nd note
- I, II, III, V
- can also be done with 7
#### Add I and V on top
You can add I and V on top of almost every chords

## Breaking the rules
### Playing a note out of scale
#### Augmented chord
This chords are often used as transitions.
aug: Playing a major chord, but use V + half-step
example: Caug: I. III. V + half-step => C, E, Ab
#### Major II Chord
This chords are often used as transitions as well.
Chord II should be minor -> switch to the corresponding major chord
#### Minor IV and V Chords
Chord IV or V should be major -> switch to the corresponding minor chord
#### Major VI Chord

#### Major III Chord

### Dressing Chords
- Playing root note some octaves lower
- Adding 7th note down
