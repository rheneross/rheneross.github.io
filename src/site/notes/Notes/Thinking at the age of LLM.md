## LLMs can't help you think
LLMs to me, looks like a car for your mind. Sure, you can go further and faster, but if you start using it for every little errand, you'll end-up sacrificing your physical health, and, in the case of LLMs, your thinking capabilities.

Also, I saw some discussions about how LLMs can help you get better ideas. I don't buy that. Given how they work, they can only help you get the most probable, generic idea.

> But now, when my brain spontaneously forms a tiny sliver of a potentially interesting concept or idea, I can just shove a few sloppy words into a prompt and almost instantly get a fully reasoned, researched, and completed thought. Minimal organic thinking required. This has had a dramatic and profound effect on my brain. My thinking systems have atrophied, and I can feel it–I can sense my slightly diminishing intuition, cleverness, and rigor. And because AI can so easily flesh out ideas, I feel less inclined to share my thoughts–no matter how developed.

> because [copilote autocomplete] happens as I'm typing, before I know what I thought and I'm ready to hand-off the rest, it happens while I'm still thinking, so now, all of the sudden, I'm being thoughts-jammed. Now I'm evaluating what it did before finishing my own thought.

## GenAI can't help you create
Why would you want to give away what makes us human?

> GenAI is like self-licking ice-cream: its replacing human doing creative endeavor (writing/art/programing). What's the point of an ice cream that is licking itself? What the point of art being made by itself?

> Now I let it fall back in the grasses.
> I hear you. I know this life is hard now.
> I know your days are precious on this earth.
> But what are you trying to be free of?
> The living? The miraculous task of it?
> Love is for the ones who love the work.

And, even if you did, it will not resonate as much with the audience you are trying to reach.
> Either way, games as en emotional escape is a meaningful and sometimes necessary experience for many. On a base level we escape somewhere that has no consequences and for a moment of safety where we are in control, and we can be the victorious.
> And a space, a story, an experience crafted by an unfathomable artificial intelligence, owned by corporations who only value shareholder value. This isn't safe, this isn't an escape where we are in control. Its the same fucking reality we already live in.

> Essentially, I think that LLM-generated dialogue only makes sense if you believe that the product of writing is words.

> But the product of writing isn't words, any more than the product of justice is prisoners, or the product of love is weddings. The product of writing is meaning.

I read on reddit that GenAI works like artists: it steal from other artists. Except artist don't "Steal": They study, imitate and take inspirations from the work and the techniques of others, view through their own eyes, through their own prisme of experiences.

GenAI is straight up spewing the most probable thing another artist (or worst, an average of other artists) will have done.
