I'm using Linux since 2010 on servers, and I had the chance to try various desktop distributions since then.
In 2025, I started daily driving CachyOS.

With the current hype around Hyprland, I'm often asked why I'm not using a tilling windows manager.
I'm working on 3 screens, so my windows are already tilled, each of them maximized on their respective monitor. I always have a terminal on my main screen, and everything is happening here anyway.

The plus side of using something mainstream like KDE is that pretty much everything works out of the box.

One thing I did like when trying Hyprland is having a monitor dedicated to coms, with Discord, Slack and Signal running on separate workspaces. I could switch workspaces, and thus apps, without moving my mouse.
