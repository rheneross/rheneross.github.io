- Find a game idea -> Take some time to figure this out!
- Scope -> Cut half -> Cut half again
	- List all the feature, estimate them (time / coolness factor / needed to have the game loop working)
- Finish the project!

# Big picture
## Make a plan
1. Define what game we are making => Single Page GDD!
2. Set an ideal release date
3. Give it a feasibility factor 0-10
4. Calculate how much dev. Time we have until ideal release date
5. How is feasibility factor now? Adjust scope,  and potentially release date
## Back planning
Define Key Milestones
1. When are the latest Steam Next Fest before release?
2. Demo should be ready one month before the start of Next Fest
3. Steam Page should be ready 1 month before inscription deadline
4. First Vertical Slice for screenshots / trailer need to be done 2 weeks before Steam page
=> Adjust again! Go back to 5.

Define Deliverables for each Milestones
## Review everything once a month
Am I on track? Will I miss my target/milestone?
=>Adjust again! Go back to 5.

# Day to day
## Plan until next Key Milestone
Define intermediate milestones at regular interval (basically sprints: i.e. one milestone ever 2 weeks)
- Describe high level goals
- Describe what you want to have in the build: What is the deliverable?
- Split into task
- There should be a build at the end!
- => That's it.
## Asynchronous stands up
- Every day everyone sends what they worked on
- compile next morning into a report
=> Remote so maybe plan a ritual everyday, maybe not work related
## Retrospective
- Play the build
- Adjust next milestone
- What's 1 thing we can improve?
