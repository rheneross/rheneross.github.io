If worrying would solve the problem, then I'd say go ahead and worry, but somehow we can't stop ourselves even when worrying solves nothing and leaves us empty-handed.\np.62\n\nWhen I'm really hooked on something, as long as I can figure out what got me hooked, I can take that process and apply it elsewhere as a way of drumming up interest.\np.63",

		"content": "My notes on the How Xalavier Nelson Does It Aftermath article.\nReally interesting takes on scope, <a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Project planning</a> for games.\nOn work\n\nNelson: I sleep six to eight hours. I wake up roughly 10 minutes before my first meeting. [...]I'm doing a lot of admin around the studio of going through emails, answering emails, chasing opportunities. I'm in meetings, collaborating with my fellow developers on solutions for things, reviewing material and figuring out what to do next. I am, yeah, doing a lot of feedback on things as they're brought in and talking about the vision of the game and whether or not something fits.\n[...]\nOne to several times a week I'm making time for developers, either inside or outside of the studio, to talk to them about what they want to do with their lives or their studios outside of our own and ways we can either support, or that any of my experience can be relevant for, what they want to do next and how they want to do it. And then after all of that stuff is done, which brings us into 5pm, 6pm territory, I have dinner with my wife, we might relax for a little bit, and then I begin what we colloquially call Night Work, which is when I get to do writing and design and documentation that typically I don't have space for during the day, that helps unblock people for the next day.\n[...]\nI'm constantly trying to calibrate my work-life balance as well, and I am treating that as a priority more than ever. But yeah, to run a studio like this in the way that I want, I know that, at least for the foreseeable future, there's no way I can have a standard 9-to-5. So finding a version of this that makes me happy and lets me be the type of person [I want to be] and show up for my family in the ways that I want, and treating that on a very individual, bespoke basis, has been the most useful thing, and that's what I try to provide for my collaborators as well.\n[...]\nWhen I notice that someone has a working pattern [...] We have conversations inside the studio of how to support them in that way, rather than try to force them in a way that doesn't fit their creative style or their natural patterns\n\nI find myself so much happier getting to, on sometimes a daily basis, figure out what matters for me and my collaborators and fix that – rather than create a perfect spreadsheet that serves no one.\n\nscope\n\nthe approach of each project we plan is in the aggressive, discipline-led way. It's aggressive positivity of, like, “I love making games – and making games that fit into our lives – so much that I won't let you put this cool thing into the game that challenges that.”\n\nvision attracted by movement\n\npeople saw how busy I was across the studio; they didn't want to talk to me about what was happening in the game. And there's always other things happening in the studio; I think a term used for this is “vision attracted by movement.” I was like, “Oh, I guess everything is moving smoothly, and we're just making the game that we scoped and discussed. Cool.” I didn't realize that, outside of my field of vision, there were ways that the game was increasing in scope that weren't visible on the top level but, in the final game, I think can absolutely be seen.\n\nThe systems you set up give you the life that you live in. You can only hope it's the life that you want to live.",

Reduce the genre to its smallest possible DNA, then build outward from there.\n\nMaking mechanics\n\nReal world activities / experiences\nFind inspiration through the way we control games\nIsolate one specific mechanic or system from another game and spine that out to do something completely new\n\nI read a lot, I like learning new things, and at some point I'll just trip over a subject or some material that I find particularly fascinating.\nSo it's not like I sit down and say, okay, I'm going to come up with a new game idea.\nIt's more like I'm kind of just exploring, browsing the world, then it's like oh, maybe I can make a game out of this.\nWill Wright\n\nTop down\nStart with the experience, then derive the gameplay\nExperience\n\nFantasy: what sort of role do you want the player to inhabit?\nStart with a theme\nHighly personal experience / autobiography\n\nConstructing a game idea\nStory, Gameplay, ... are not game ideas: they are starting point.\nYou need to turn it into something that can actually be played.\nOne common structure:\nAsk yourself, in an individual level or scene:\n\nWhat is the player's goal / the win state?\nWhat is pushing player away from this win state / what are the obstacles?\nWhat are theses obstacles pushing the player toward, what is the fail state?\nWhat is the player doing to overcome those obstacles and reach the win state / what are the player's actions?\n\nGeneral ideation tips and tricks\n\nBreak games down into their smallest element, this will help you pick / mash-up / changes / and remix this elements into new forms\nReally interrogate the games you play, consider their pros and cons with a critic's mentality. Flaws can be opportunities for new games\nChallenge convention: take what is expected of a genre and look at what will happen if you flip it on its head\nPlay everything\nImpose a limitation or restriction on yourself\nEnter game jams with interesting theme\n\nWhat's something that normally takes a lot of space that would be interesting or unique if you game it less space?\nTim &quot;Walaber&quot; Fitzrandolph on Ludum Dare 54 theme &quot;Limited Space&quot;\n\nOpen your editor and start exploring\nSurround yourself with music and art\nDo literally anything else than designing / brainstorming\nKeep your ideas small - think of a game idea as a seed to be cultivated and grow during the entire development process\n\nIs this idea any good\nDon't make the first idea you think of. Ask yourself few questions\nCan you make it?\n\nIf you can make the gameplay prototype in one or two days, then you can make the game in one or two years\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Jonas</a>\n\nAre you passionate by the idea? You'll probably work on it for years, so you better love it.\nWill this game stand out?\nHook\nDoes the game idea has a hook?\nSomething new and different.\n\nSome interesting bit of information about the game that compels people to try it, or to discuss it\nRyan Clark\n\nImagine what the headline of an article about your game be?\nIf you can't write a catchy headline from your game idea, it probably doesn't have a hook.\nAnchor\nBut don't get too stressed about the hook either\n\nYou can't go overboard and wow them with a hook that is so out there, so original, so revolutionary that potential buyers have no idea what your game even is.\nIf it sounds too risky to them, they are going to pause, say 'looks cool but I don't trust it'. Then move on.\nChris Zukowski\n\nThink about an anchor: something that makes the game feels familiar or safe.\n\nMake a game that is simple, with something unexpected. For example a tower defense game, where towers can be damaged by your own bullets.\nSimple gets people in the door, unexpected gets them hooked\nZachary Richman\n\nAppeal\n<a class=\"internal-link is-unresolved\" href=\"/404\" target=\"\">Jonas</a> recommends to focus less on hooks, but more on what he calls appeal.\n\nAppeal is everything that draws you into the game, before you play the game.\n\nDifferent kind of appeal:\n\nFantasy appeal: &quot;I want to be this&quot;\nExploration appeal\nToy appeal: &quot;I want to touch this, to interact with this&quot;\nChallenge appeal\nNostalgic appeal\n...\nTo see if you your game is appealing, ask yourself:\n\nHow would you market it?\n\nWhen I'm even thinking about the idea, I'm thinking &quot;How can I express this in the trailer?&quot;. If I can't imagine right now a cool trailer for this, then it's probably not worse pursuing.\nLucas Pope\n\nThinking about the trailer makes you ask: Can I show the world what makes this game idea interesting?\n\nWhen you start a project you don't necessarily spend a lot of time thinking about the Steam store assets you're going to end up with, and maybe you should.\nTom Francis\n\nIs the game idea actually fun?\nOur brain are terrible video games simulators: all ideas seems fun in our heads, but once we actually make it, we realize it's boring, too complicated, and has disastrous design problems.\nThe only way to know for sure is to build a prototype.",

Les lutes antiracistes, féministes, ... sont des luttes des classes.\nLa religion capitaliste se base sur la croyance qu'il faut une avance en capital pour produire.\nCependant des déjà-là communistes ont fait preuve du contraire : par exemple la mise en place de la sécurité sociale montre que l'on peut produire avec une avance en salaire.\nLa révolution communiste n'aura pas lieu, et n'est pas souhaitable, en effet la prise de pouvoir sans avoir par avant changé les méthodes de production ne permettra pas l'effet bénéfique escompter (cf. révolution russe d'octobre 1917 &amp; Lénine)\nIl faut transformer les méthodes de production, en s'appuyant sur des modèles existant (Sécurité Sociale), et proposer une avance en salaire en lieu et place de l'avance en capital.\nSalaire à la personne, dès 18 ans pour toutes personnes résidente sur le territoire\nPrise de décision des travailleurs dans les entreprises\nPropriété d'usage des moyens de production aux travailleurs\nPropriété patrimonial des moyens de productions aux entités territoriales compétentes (différentes entre une boulangerie et un réseau national de transport par exemple)",

		"content": "My note on the video Using Analytics to Create Viral Games by Gavin Eisenbeisz\nViral games are &quot;made&quot; by content creators.\nContent creators play games that increase their retention rate, because that's how they get paid\nMake games that naturally creates videos with high retention rates.\n[[Game Retention Study.pdf]] was made studying retention on no-commentaries gameplay video.\n(So something that directly matches how your game can create high retention rates for content creators)\nHow to increase retention rate on videos\n\nWork toward a goal\n\nAuthor's DevLog template video:\n\n1st 5 seconds: explain the problem / story -&gt; what goal do I need to accomplish in this video\n10-15seconds: Additional context\n45-60 seconds: Rapide progress toward the goal\nTwist / Additional challenge\nRest of the video: Progress interrupted by intermediate conflicts\n\nClose to the curve in [[Game Retention Study.pdf]]\nConstant remind the public of the goal and where we are -&gt; like in a car ride with child &quot;Are we there yet?!&quot; -&gt; Progress bar\n\nGame features decreasing retention rate\nKeep in mind that some features are bad for retention in a video, but good for player experience, so it's a balance.\n\nBad menu screen 🔽\nApplicable only on no-commentaries gameplay video, because on edited video, bad menus will be edited-out most likely\nPlayer deaths 🔼\nEvery time the player dies, you loose retention -&gt; the tension to move toward the goal is release, so you loose viewers\nWhy ? They are followed by long game over screens, then loading screen, then have to retrace already traveled paths\n=&gt; Cut respawn time to the smallest possible time / instant\nIn horror game though, players death is expected at least once with a jumpscare\nLevel / Match completion / Win screens 🔽\nProbably cut in edited video but valid for livestream / no-commentaries gameplay\nNotes / Wall of text ⏫\nNotes are worse for retention the longer they are and the sooner in the game they appear\n=&gt; If note can't be avoided: Few words, big fonts, pictures, later in the game\nExpositions dump ⏫\nSimilar to notes - Big cinematics / monologs / dialogs. Worst if not acted\nBacktracking 🔼\nWhen player goes to a long dead-end path / when player died and the waypoint is too far off\nCredits 🔽\nPeople leave as soon as the credits rolls\n=&gt; Put the credits as a button in you main menu\nWalking simulator 🔽\nVariety in environment is needed, as well as landmarks, and goal visible from a distance\nDullness 🔼\nOverly dull / slow gameplay moment\nLighting / Obscure style 🔽\nHarsh art style / difficult to read the scene\nRepetition 🔼\nCore gameplay repeating in under 10sec\n=&gt; Add variety in the gameplay\n\nFeatures that help hold retention\n\nChase scene 🔼\nSlowly increase the intensity of the chase as time goes on.\nMaybe inching the player closer and closer to dying, without actually dying.\nEnemy must be close, and visible\nDon't end the scene to abruptly =&gt; transition to a new goal\nBoss fights 🔼\nParkour 🔽\nNot a lot of data on this one, but even in the same game, levels with a lot of parkour holds attention more than levels with high action\nClear definition of goals ⏫\nMost important feature, basically encompassing all of the above: having a clear goal is creating anticipation of something to come and increases stakes. Creating features with clear definition of goals is key to keep audience engaged (and thus make content creator more likely to pick up you game)\n\nFeatures that bump retention\n\nJumpscares ⏫\nPeople are re-watching the video at this point.\nSubtle jumpscares / stinger are not as effective, but still work\nRe-using jumpscares loose the impact =&gt; Avoir re-using the same jumpscare\nSecrets 🔽\nSexualization 🔼\nPersonal note: I don't want that in my game anyway\nRandom interesting moments 🔼\nRandom / Funny / Out of the blue moments that happen once in a game\nTrippy stuff / illusions 🔽\n\nNuance features and other notes\n\nAction scenes\nPlayer is in control of the situation (vs a chase where the player is not at all in control)\nNo real challenge / tension, the player is going to win\nActions scenes can cause bump, and hold for some seconds, but retention will drop drastically after that\nSlower / more strategic multiplayer shooter (PUBG) are good are retaining views, because the tension build, the action is intense and the resolution is uncertain\nCutscenes\nCan be bad, like big expo dump / long dialogs\nBut good if short / show the goal\nMystery and Tension\nA mysterious story can hold attention, but not if it's build with big expodumps\n=&gt; brief conversations / environment cues\nSubtitles\nNuance because sometimes the content creator will do the voice adapted to their audience",
